# pandoc

Some scripts to facilitate converting markdown to .docx files.

We pull in a pagebreak.lua Lua filter from https://github.com/pandoc-ext/pagebreak
to handle page breaks.

We also provide a reference.docx file that simply has most default font styles
set to Times New Roman instead of Cambria and Calibri.
